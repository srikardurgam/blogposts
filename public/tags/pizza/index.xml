      <description>Welcome to another blog, this week I will be analyzing pizza reviews, this data again comes from tidytuesday project. I am very excited to visualize some of this data. I have never worked with geographical data and I want to possibly add a map to this blog(You’ll find out if I was successful or not.). I am also a huge fan of Dave Portnoy’s show reviewing pizza, the idea behind this show is basically that he takes ONE SINGLE BITE of a pizza joint’s cheese pizza and rates on a scale of 1 to 10.</description>
