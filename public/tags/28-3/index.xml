      <description>Ok here we go. Full disclosure, I am an Atlanta Falcons fan through and through.I love this team. Time to be honest the 2020 Atlanta Falcons are a terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible football team. They were also terrible in 2019 and 2018, just facts. In today’s post I’ll try to analytically explain why this team needs to not only fire their head coach but also try to answer the million dollar question “what went wrong since 2016”.</description>
