<p>President Trump has a very unique relationship with Twitter. In many ways he revolutionized using twitter for politicians it is his virtual microphone and his very important tool that helps him reach his audiences by the click of the button. So I wanted to take an analytical approach and really understand what he has to say.</p>
<p>I will be using the rtweets package to extract all tweets and also do some topic modeling to explore some of the topics he has been talking about. The following week I will follow this up Joe Biden tweets how they matchup with Trump’s twitter.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned before in my <a href="https://srikardatascience.netlify.app/post/first-presidetial-debate-analysis/">First Presidential Debate Analysis</a>, my goal here isn’t to sway you in one direction or anything but only to provide you with an analytical view of what President Trump is saying on twitter.</p>

Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our Country. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravaged our cities…

<p>There is a limiting factor here, we are only able to extract approx. 3200 of President Trump’s tweets, believe it or not that’s only less than one month of tweets from 09/25/2020 to 10/17/2020.</p>
<p>First I am going to make a wordcloud, there is some words that need be filter and I will include them in the filter statement below.</p>

<p>Its kind of hard to read this word cloud, obviously the words Biden, Trump and Joe are the most commonly used but lets look at the top 15 words in these tweets.</p>

<p>Very intersting that we see North Carolina here. Before moving onto the sentiment analysis, lets see on what days does President Trump tweet the most!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TweetsbyDay &lt;- TrumpTweetsClean %&gt;% 
               select(text, created_at) %&gt;%
               mutate(day = format(created_at, format = &quot;%A&quot;)) %&gt;%
               count(day) %&gt;%
               ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(day,-n), y=n)) + geom_col(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +
               geom_text(aes(label = n), position = position_dodge(0.9), vjust = 0) + 
               labs (x= &quot;Day&quot;, y= &quot;Number of Tweets&quot;)

<p>Now lets do some sentiment analysis, and find out which words President Trump uses in positive and negative terms.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TrumpTweetsClean %&gt;% unnest_tokens(word,text) %&gt;%

                     ggplot(aes(reorder(word,n),n , fill = sentiment)) + 
                     geom_col() + 
                     coord_flip() +

<p>We have the regular suspects here. Obviously we would expect words like fake, radical, bad and crime would have a negative sentiment attached with them. Now let’s move on to Topic Modeling. Topic Modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of documents(in this case tweets). It is very similar to clustering of numerical data.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to process here, I am not a huge fan of the 16 topics chart but I think the 8 and 10 are very helpful. I am not going to comment on what each of these topics mean. I think that would be hard but this will give us an idea of what he is thinking and tweeting about on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To conclude, this was a very fun blogspot I can’t wait to see what Vice President Joe Biden has to say, as always I want to reiterate that the point of this blog isn’t to influence your decision, however I am only trying to analytically understand what the President is trying convey to his followers via twitter.</p>
